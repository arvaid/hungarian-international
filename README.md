# Hungarian International

## What's this?

This is the keyboard layout I use on all my computers. It's based on the US international layout but with additional [dead keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_key) for the Hungarian letters `ő` and `ű`.

## Installation

Download the [package](https://github.com/arvaid/hungarian-international/releases/tag/1.0). Unzip it, run setup.exe.

## How to use

It's recommended that you do not use it with any other keyboard layouts. Select the layout in the settings app under 'Language and Region' then remove any other layouts.

Regular and double accented characters can be typed with the following combinations:

| Base | Modifier | Result |
| ---- | -------- | ------ |
| `a`  | `'`      | `á`    |
| `e`  | `'`      | `é`    |
| `i`  | `'`      | `í`    |
| `o`  | `'`      | `ó`    |
| `u`  | `'`      | `ú`    |
| `o`  | `"`      | `ö`    |
| `u`  | `"`      | `ü`    |
| `o`  | `=`      | `ő`    |
| `u`  | `=`      | `ű`    |
| `A`  | `'`      | `Á`    |
| `E`  | `'`      | `É`    |
| `I`  | `'`      | `Í`    |
| `O`  | `'`      | `Ó`    |
