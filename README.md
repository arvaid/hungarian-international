# Hungarian International

## What's this?

This is the keyboard layout I use on all my computers. It's based on the US international layout but with additional [dead keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_key) for the Hungarian letters `ő` and `ű`.

## Installation

Download the [package](https://github.com/arvaid/hungarian-international/releases/tag/1.0). Unzip it, run setup.exe.

## How to use

Select the layout in the settings app under 'Language and Region' then remove any other layouts.

It's best to not use it with any other keyboard layouts – because of some bugs with custom keyboard layouts on modern Windows. If you want a real solution, I recommend [wincompose](https://github.com/samhocevar/wincompose).

Regular and double accented characters can be typed with the following combinations:

| Base | Modifier | Result |
| ---- | -------- | ------ |
| `a`  | `'`      | `á`    |
| `e`  | `'`      | `é`    |
| `i`  | `'`      | `í`    |
| `o`  | `'`      | `ó`    |
| `u`  | `'`      | `ú`    |
| `o`  | `"`      | `ö`    |
| `u`  | `"`      | `ü`    |
| `o`  | `=`      | `ő`    |
| `u`  | `=`      | `ű`    |
| `A`  | `'`      | `Á`    |
| `E`  | `'`      | `É`    |
| `I`  | `'`      | `Í`    |
| `O`  | `'`      | `Ó`    |
| `U`  | `'`      | `Ú`    |
| `O`  | `"`      | `Ö`    |
| `U`  | `"`      | `Ü`    |
| `O`  | `=`      | `Ő`    |
| `U`  | `=`      | `Ű`    |
